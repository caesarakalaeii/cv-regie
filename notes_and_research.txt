Human detection and tracking using YOLOv4/5: https://towardsdatascience.com/picking-fast-people-detector-working-with-opencv-on-cpu-in-2021-ff8d752088af

to circumvent webcam exclusivity two modes seem promising:
1. split incoming webcam feed into two, one for OBS, one for cv (lower res?) --> cropping via OBS Websocket
2. export already cropped feed to OBS, (lower res for detection still possible?)
